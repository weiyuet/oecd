Electricity generation is defined as electricity generated from fossil fuels, nuclear power plants, hydro power plants (excluding pumped storage), geothermal systems, solar panels, biofuels, wind, etc. It includes electricity produced in electricity-only plants and in combined heat and power plants. Both main activity producer and autoproducer plants are included, where data are available. Main activity producers generate electricity for sale to third parties as their primary activity. Autoproducers generate electricity wholly or partly for their own use as an activity supporting their primary activity. Both types of plants may be privately or publicly owned. This indicator is measured in gigawatt hours and in percentage of total energy generation. [`OECD`](https://data.oecd.org/energy/electricity-generation.htm)

### Crude Oil Production

Crude oil production is defined as the quantities of oil extracted from the ground after the removal of inert matter or impurities. It includes crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and additives. This indicator is measured in thousand tonne of oil equivalent (toe).Crude oil is a mineral oil consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons of natural origin, yellow to black in colour, and of variable density and viscosity. NGLs are the liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons produced in the manufacture, purification and stabilisation of natural gas. Additives are non-hydrocarbon substances added to or blended with a product to modify its properties, for example, to improve its combustion characteristics (e.g. MTBE and tetraethyl lead).
