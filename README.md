Electricity generation is defined as electricity generated from fossil fuels, nuclear power plants, hydro power plants (excluding pumped storage), geothermal systems, solar panels, biofuels, wind, etc. It includes electricity produced in electricity-only plants and in combined heat and power plants. Both main activity producer and autoproducer plants are included, where data are available. Main activity producers generate electricity for sale to third parties as their primary activity. Autoproducers generate electricity wholly or partly for their own use as an activity supporting their primary activity. Both types of plants may be privately or publicly owned. This indicator is measured in gigawatt hours and in percentage of total energy generation. [`OECD`](https://data.oecd.org/energy/electricity-generation.htm)
